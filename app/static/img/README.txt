Place your dashboard background image in this folder as:

  dashboard-bg.jpg

Then refresh the app. The dashboard section at the top will use it automatically. You can use JPG or PNG; if you change the filename, also update the style attribute on the #dashboard-section element in app/templates/index.html.
